# Tips for submitting a proposal or paper to PAPIs — and a few rules

This document completes the guidelines for the [PAPIs Call for Proposals](http://cfp.papis.io).

## How to craft a good talk proposal

Attendees have different levels of technical expertise, and also different levels of knowledge of Machine Learning (from beginner to advanced). **Start by identifying your main audience and the level of technicality of your talk**. Your presentation should either directly help them, or inspire/inform them about something they don’t already know. The core value to our attendees of what you’re presenting should be clearly stated in your proposal. What will they be able to do after they see your presentation that they can’t do now?

We believe that **great presentations should be practical and focused**. For instance, instead of presenting a portfolio of things you have done or a list of problems you have solved, it’s better to show one specific, unique thing in enough detail. We also highly encourage to show live demos, when possible; this can be very useful to make your presentation more concrete and engaging.

Some examples of popular presentations at previous PAPIs conferences:

- ML in the Wild: [Machine Learning, Technical Debt, and You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V18AsBIHlWs)
- ML Engineering: [Open Source Machine Learning Deployment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JdFey7oAiI); [Scaling Machine Learning as a Service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpnszJ_3Ong)
- New ML techniques: [The future of ML is decentralized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgiPrYhBYYo); [Techniques for Distributed TensorFlow on Hops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu6Flh9NnM8)
- Tools: [PredictionIO tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeGnILRIdUk&list=PLex5Agivp-gh3tYo9yCY9Dgcj3nXYol1k&index=13); [DIY Predictive Modeling Cluster with Kubernetes, Dask and JupyterHub](https://youtu.be/iRHJYXu5qx8)

## How to submit your proposal

Our proposal form has two fields that attendees will see on the program (Title and Abstract), and two fields that only reviewers will see (Details and Pitch). Please use tags to help reviewers identify the type of proposal you’re submitting.

It is possible to submit several proposals through our CfP application. However, we have a policy of not having more than 2 talks from speakers from the same company, in an effort to promote different approaches to ML applications at the conference.

### Title, Session Format, Track, Abstract & Bio

These are what attendees will see in the program. The title and abstract should be compelling and to-the-point. Tell a story. Why should attendees come to your presentation and what will they get out of it? Note that the abstract is limited to 600 characters.

Please identify the track which is best suited to your proposal (see our CfP guidelines for track descriptions), while avoiding to select the "general" track. If you think your talk could also fit in another track, please explain in the *Details* field.

The default session format is *20' Presentation*. However, if you are submitting to the Tools track, you must choose between *10' Demo* or *30' Tutorial*.

Your bio won’t be seen by reviewers in the 1st round of reviews but we will use it when advertising your presentation if it is accepted. Please include your current position and organization.

### Details

Only reviewers will see this. Please take care here to refrain from identifying who you are since our first round of review is blind, and we appreciate your efforts to respect that as much as possible.

It's ok to use the abstract as a teaser of your presentation, but please use the *Details* field to go into more depth about what you’ll cover, and to be as specific as possible on the content of your presentation. You can think of this as an "extended abstract", and the recommended length is 2000 characters or more. We invite you to...

- reveal the "secret sauce" of your presentation
- explain any twists you’ll include that may not be evident in the title or abstract
- include references and comparisons to related work
- let us know if you will be showing a demo, sharing code, or an API (and give links to them, if any)
- include an outline of your presentation (with rough time estimates)

### Pitch

Only reviewers will see this. Pitch is a good place to tell reviewers why PAPIs needs this presentation, and why you’re the right person to give it at PAPIs. How will your presentation help the program, or fill a specific need? Why are you excited about this topic?

### Tags

Please use tags to identify your target audience (*ML beginners, ML practitioners, ML experts*) and the level of technicality of your talk (*non-technical, somewhat technical, very technical*).

Please tag your proposal with *demo* if you'll be showing a demo, and explain how long you plan the demo to be in the *Details* field.

Please tag your proposal with *code* if you'll be showing code.


## Peer-reviewed articles/papers

We encourage authors of accepted proposals to complement their presentation with an article that will be peer-reviewed, included in our proceedings, and published in [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research](http://proceedings.mlr.press/). These articles are not limited to research papers, but they can also be technical papers, industrial experience reports, review papers, primers, perspective papers, essays, etc.

Publishing an article in a peer-reviewed journal such as PMLR requires some effort, but it is a great way to contribute to your reputation and that of your organization. Previous authors include teams at Microsoft, Uber Engineering, Upwork, Dataiku, BigML... Peer-reviewed articles advance the community's knowledge as they provide more details on what you did, for others to learn from. They're also a great way to build authors' careers, and to prove to partners, clients or investors that the quality of your work is recognized.

### Example articles from previous PAPIs conferences

- [Li, 2016](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v67/li17a/li17a.pdf): Industrial experience report on Uber's internal ML-as-a-Service platform, Michelangelo (also see [talk video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpnszJ_3Ong) and [blog article](https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/))
- [Azure ML, 2015](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v50/azureml15.pdf) (Industrial experience report)
- [Gutierrez, 2016](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v67/gutierrez17a/gutierrez17a.pdf) (Research paper)
- [Cetinsoy, 2015](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v50/cetinsoy15.pdf) (Review paper)
- More in our [2017](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v82/), [2016](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v67/) and [2015](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v50/) proceedings

### Preparing your article

- We invite you to write your article on [Authorea](https://authorea.com) using [this template](https://authorea.com/users/242822/articles/319964-template-for-papis-proceedings). You should aim for 3,000 - 4,000 words. (Authorea is a great platform to read and write scientific articles on the web. It serves as a writing tool, a platform for publishing web-based “pre-prints”, and for reviewing them — via comments.)
- When ready, please add your article to the [PAPIs group](https://authorea.com/inst/19295) and share the link to it in the Comments section of the CfP app (it can be a public or private link — whatever you're most comfortable with).
- Once your Authorea article has been reviewed by the PAPIs Program Committee, and you've been able to take feedback into account, please export it to PDF and check that all looks ok. Articles are typically ~8 pages long (not including figures nor bibliography) in their PDF version.
- We ask you to complete and sign a [release form](https://github.com/PAPIsdotio/general/blob/master/proceedings/release.pdf) before publication.
- The final PDF version ("camera-ready") will be published in the PMLR journal. The article will also be made public on Authorea (if that's not the case already).
