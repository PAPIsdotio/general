# Tips for submitting a proposal to PAPIs — and a few rules

This document completes the CfP guidelines for [PAPIs conferences](http://papis.io), which you'll find at [cfp.papis.io](http://cfp.papis.io/).

## How to craft a good proposal

Attendees have different levels of experience — from totally new to very experienced. **Start by identifying your main audience and the level of your talk**. Your presentation should either directly help them, or inspire/inform them about something they don’t already know. The core value to our attendees of what you’re presenting should be clearly stated in your proposal. What will they be able to do after they see your presentation that they can’t do now?

We believe that **great presentations should be practical and focused**. For instance, instead of presenting something general or showing a portfolio of things you / your company have done, it’s better to show one specific, unique thing in enough detail.

A few more remarks:

- Screenshots and live demos can be very useful to make your presentation more concrete and engaging.
- If your presentation is centered on a particular commercial tool or product, we may only accept it as a sponsored presentation.
- Here are examples of some of the most popular presentations at previous conferences:
  - Business and introductory presentations:
    - [Big Wins with Small Data](http://lanyrd.com/2015/papis2015/sdpcdh/)
    - [Business reasons for automating decisions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKQJAu6k7pQ)
  - Advanced presentations:
    - [Scaling Machine Learning as a Service](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v67/li17a/li17a.pdf)
    - [Protocols and Structures for Inference (research paper)](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v50/montgomery15.pdf)
  - Hands-on technical presentations:
    - [PredictionIO tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeGnILRIdUk&list=PLex5Agivp-gh3tYo9yCY9Dgcj3nXYol1k&index=13)

## How to submit your proposal

Our proposal form has two fields that attendees will see on the program (Title and Abstract), and two fields that only reviewers will see (Details and Pitch). Please also use tags for reviewers to identify the type of proposal you’re submitting. It is possible to submit several proposals through our CfP application. Note that we have a policy of not having more than 2 talks from speakers from the same company, in an effort to promote different approaches to ML applications at the conference.

### Title, Abstract & Bio

These are what attendees will see in the program. Title and abstract should be compelling and to-the-point. Tell a story. Why should attendees come to your presentation and what will they get out of it?

Your bio won’t be seen by reviewers in the 1st round of reviews but we will use it when advertising your presentation if it is accepted. Please include your current position and organization.

### Details

Only reviewers will see this. Please take care here to refrain from identifying who you are since our first round of review is blind, and we appreciate your efforts to respect that as much as possible.

Details is a good place to go into more depth about what you’ll cover and to be as specific as possible on the content of your presentation. We invite you to...

- include an outline
- reveal the secret sauce of your presentation
- explain any twists you’ll include that may not be evident in the title or abstract.

Please also let us know...

- if you intend to include a live demo or live coding (and intended duration)
- the main audience for your talk (see "About the conference" section above).

### Pitch

Only reviewers will see this. Pitch is a good place to tell reviewers why PAPIs needs this presentation, and why you’re the right person to give it at PAPIs. How will your presentation help the program, or fill a specific need? Why are you excited about this topic?

### Tags

Please assign multiple tags to help us identify how technical your presentation will be (Non-Technical, Somewhat Technical, Mostly Technical) and the required ML knowledge (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).

### Industrial experience reports, technical, review and research papers

Attaching a report or paper to your proposal is optional but it's highly appreciated. We will publish final accepted papers in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (see our [2016](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v67/) and [2015 proceedings](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v50/) as an example). We are not limited to research papers but also welcome industrial experience reports, technical papers, and review papers.

- In addition to submitting the proposal form, please also send one of the following (anonymized) documents via this [upload form](https://papisdotio.wufoo.com/forms/xst26ab1dgwqty/), in PDF format and using the [JMLR style](http://www.jmlr.org/format/format.html):
  - an extended abstract of 2 pages or more (references and comparisons to related work should be included, but details of implementation can be omitted)
  - OR a short paper of 4 pages
  - OR a long paper of up to 8 pages
- Please make sure the PDF file has the same name as your proposal title.

Publishing a paper requires some effort but it is another great way to contribute to your reputation and that of your company. Previous authors include teams at Microsoft, Uber Engineering, Upwork, Dataiku, BigML...
